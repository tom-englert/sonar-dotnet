<p>Successful Zip Bomb attacks occur when an application expands untrusted archive files without controlling the size of the expanded data, which can
lead to denial of service. A Zip bomb is usually a malicious archive file of a few kilobytes of compressed data but turned into gigabytes of
uncompressed data. To achieve this extreme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression_ratio">compression ratio</a>, attackers will
compress irrelevant data (eg: a long string of repeated bytes). </p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<p>Archives to expand are untrusted and:</p>
<ul>
  <li> There is no validation of the number of entries in the archive. </li>
  <li> There is no validation of the total size of the uncompressed data. </li>
  <li> There is no validation of the ratio between the compressed and uncompressed archive entry. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Define and control the ratio between compressed and uncompressed data, in general the data compression ratio for most of the legit archives is
  1 to 3. </li>
  <li> Define and control the threshold for maximum total size of the uncompressed data. </li>
  <li> Count the number of file entries extracted from the archive and abort the extraction if their number is greater than a predefined threshold, in
  particular it's not recommended to recursively expand archives (an entry of an archive could be also an archive). </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<pre>
For Each entry As ZipArchiveEntry in archive.Entries
    ' entry.FullName could contain parent directory references ".." and the destinationPath variable could become outside of the desired path
    string destinationPath = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(path, entry.FullName))
    entry.ExtractToFile(destinationPath) ' Sensitive, extracts the entry to a file

    Dim stream As Stream
    stream = entry.Open() ' Sensitive, the entry is about to be extracted
Next
</pre>
